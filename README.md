# roomba-mower-program
 Project for CPRE 288. Program a roomba to navigate an obstacle course without user input
 
 This was a large group project. This large group was put together by combining 3 pairs of partners. Prior functionality was implemented in pairs, final functionality was implemented as a group.

## My files/methods

 My partner and I provided the UART and servo code from previous labs for this project.
 
 I worked on moving the roomba around obstacles, designing the object scan system, and implemented a good chunk of the main loop (I was a software engineer among Computer Engineers, I felt a bit more comfortable spitting out a bunch of code at a time)
 
 Relevant files are:
 
 - uart.c
 - servo.c
 - main.c
